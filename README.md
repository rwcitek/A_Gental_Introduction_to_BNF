## Detailed Venn Diagram of Grammar types

Contained inside Context Free Grammars are:



Linear grammars
Within linear grammars are two proper subsets:

1. Left linear grammars
2. Right linear grammars

Regular grammars are in these 2 subsets.

Another  type of linear grammar is the balanced parens example.

IOW: A to the n B to the n, where n >= 0

```BNF
<S> ::= "(" S ")"
  | Eps
```

The above grammars match all these strings:

"", "()", "(())", "((()))", "(((())))", ...

The above grammar is the canonical "Hello World" of CFGs.

## Regular languages

### Inductive list: Natural numbers

A natural number can be defined in BNF inductively by prepending  the rule to itself
before a single digit:

```BNF
<S> ::= <S> <Digit>
<Digit> ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
```



## Types of Context Free Grammars

There are 2 common types of CFGs: "LL(K)" and "LR(K)".
A complete list would also contain "RR(K)" and "RL(K)".

The meaning of the letters in the acronym:

- "L" : Left to right scanning of the input string.
- Derivation type
  * "L" : Left most derivation
  * "R" : Right most derivation
- "(K)" : The K in the parens is the count of tokens of look-ahead to choose between alternates.




### Association between Grammars and Parsers

A grammar is said to be either LL(K) or LR(K) depending on what type of parser
can be constructed from it. 

### LL(k) Grammars

A grammar that is is LL(K) is one where a LL(K) parser can be constructed
from it. A LL(K) parser is said to be a top-down parser.

### Problems with LL(K) parsers

#### Direct left recursion

```BNF
<S> ::= <S> a
``` 

Using a top down approach here will result in infinite recursion or a stack overflow
if using a recursive descent parser.

To fix this, replace direct left recursion with a new rule
which uses an alternative and right recursion and  Epsilon:

```BNF
<S> ::= <S-Prime>
<S-Prime> ::= a <S-Prime>
  | Eps
```


#### Indirect left recursion

```BNF
<S> ::= <W> <Y> x
<W> ::= <Y> z
<Y> ::= <S> foo
```

Eventually, S will be replaced with W which willbe replaced by Y which will finally be replaced by S.
Resulting in left recursion again.


The strategy for this is to introduce more intermediate new rules which eventually
lead to a form of the type: S goes to S {Beta}
Wherein, the above strategy to replace direct left recursion can be employed.
### LR(K) Grammar

A LR(K) grammar is one that can be used to construct a bottom-up parser.

### Paper from Donald Knuth (1965)

[https://web.archive.org/web/20120315152151/http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~mckeeman/cs48/mxcom/doc/knuth65.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20120315152151/http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~mckeeman/cs48/mxcom/doc/knuth65.pdf)


### Top down parsers

A top down parser starts with the start non terminal symbol and proceeds
to alternately consume and terminal tokens and expand non terminals as each rule
in the grammar is encountered.
A derivation tree (CST/Parse tree) is constructed from the root down
finished in only terminals as leaves of the tree.
Each non terminal on the left side of a rule in the grammar is said to "produce"
a sequence of terminals or non terminals which are called productions.


LL(1) parsers are popular in programming language parsers because they can be
constructed with a recursive descent parser (RDP).

### Bottom up parsers

A bottom up parser constructs the derivation  tree (CST/parse tree) in reverse.
Terminal tokens are consumed and stacked until a non terminal can be constructed.
The process continues building up higher inner non terminal nodes in the tree
until only the root non terminal is reached.
In a LR(K) parser, the direction of the arrow between the LHS and the RHS of a rule
is reversed. Each rule is said to take a list of terminals and non terminals
and reduce them into a LHS non terminal. Therefore, each RHS of a rule is said
to be called a "reduction".


LR(1) parsers are mostly constructed with parser generators like YACC or Bison and their cousins.
These are often called shift/reduce parsers and driven by a lookup table
constructed by the above parser generators from a formal grammar, often similar to 
BNF notation. {YACC Syntax}

#### Shift/Reduce

- Shift : Push(1 Token) on the stack
- Reduce : Pop (N items from stack), Push (1 Non terminal onto the stack.

A YACC-like parser generator will attempt to construct a lookup table from a BNF-like
language specification.

The cells of this table consists of these 4 types of actions.

1. Shift: Push 1 terminal on the stack and goto state X
2. Reduce N : Pop N itemss of the stack, push the LHS non terminal onto the stack. and goto State Y
3. Accept : Accept the entire string as correct. Parsing stops.
4. Error : Reject the string as incorrect. Parsing stops.

Ambiguous grammars can result in errors when constructing the lookup table
by a YACC-like parser generator. These are called  shift/reduce conflicts
or Reduce/Reduce conflicts.
While building the table, a determination on whether to place a Shift action or
Reduce action can not be made. This is usually a warning and the default
will be to place a shift action.

Reduce/Reduce errors are caused by  having the exact sequence of terminals and
non terminals in 2 or more rules. The lookup table maker cannot determine
whether which  LHS non terminal of  of rule 1 or rule 2 to place at that 
position in the table.


LR(K) parsers can parse a larger range of of CFGs than LL(K).

## Glossary

### Sentence

A string of tokens that make up a complete instance of a string in a language L.
Computer source files are examples of sentences.

### Sentential form

A part of or complete expanse of a sentence.
A sentitial form is any part of a string that can be derived from the start symbol
of the language's grammar.
A  Sentential form consists of any terminal or non terminals after 0 or more steps
in the derivation has occurred. The final Sentential form is the input sentence
after the  entire derivation has occurred and consists of only terminal symbols.

### Derivation

A sequence of non terminal expansions that begins with the starting non terminal
and finishes with a Concrete Syntax/Parse tree where the leaves are all the 
terminals in the input string.

### Non terminal

A name of a rule that consists of one or more productions. {See Production}
A non terminal must be expanded into one of its possible productions when
deriving a string in the language.

### Terminal

A string or token in the language that cannot be further expanded.
Terminals form the leaves of derivation trees. Terminals can occur in the RHS
of a production, but cannot occur in the LHS of a rule.

### Production

A production is the RHS of a rule and can consistof one or more of terminals or
non terminals. A rule can have one or more alternate productions.

### Rule

A rule in a grammar consists of a non terminal, an delimiter and one or more
productions. {CFG and Regular grammars}

### Grammar

A grammar {in BNF notation} consists of one or more rules. A grammar must
also indicate the start symbol of the grammar. This might be inferred if the first
rule in the BNF document is the start symbol.

### Python

The full [E]BNF notation for Python version 3.10 can be found at:
[https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html)

It uses a combination of EBNF and PEG notation. One more example of the many
varieties of BNF in the wild!


FORTRAN (I.B.M. 19554)
Although created by team led by John Backus, could not find a BNF for it.


### Ruby

EBNF syntax for Ruby [PDF]
[https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/cse305/RubyBNF.pdf]{https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/cse305/RubyBNF.pdf}

Ruby still uses Bison, a YACC-like parser generator to create its parser.
Ruby is, therefore, a LR(1) language.
